### Built with

- HTML
- TailwindCSS

## Reflection

In this project I built on the Tailwind skills I developed in my [last challenge](https://github.com/lyons-frontend-mentor/qr-code-component). This time, in addition to the padding/margin/typography styling, I had to consider using Flexbox with Tailwind as well. This didn't prove too difficult, as I already know Flexbox pretty well (though I can always learn more about it); it was mainly a matter of using it with Tailwind. Getting the column-to-row switch was a bit tricky to figure out, but I think I found a satisfactory solution.

### Continued development

I'll continue working on the more basic Frontend Mentor challenges to get a better feel for TailwindCSS.
